## This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

### This branch is for Spring quarter 2023, INFO 340 Section BB Group 03.
### We will continuously update the readme file as we are working through the project.

### Folders and Navigation of our repo
- project-draft folder consist all the html and js file we create prior to the final version. (some of the file path need a redirection, since we moved then into this folder after writing the code) 
- myapp2 folder will consist all the latest code for our website written in react using jsx.

### Initial Setup
node installation 
npm install
npm start

### Use subbranch to edit and then push it to the main branch. Attached is a example workflow of git.

git checkout <branch name> ( to switch to the new branch u just created)
edit and save the files
git status ( to see your update is ready on the new branch)
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push process as usual.
```

### create a pull request, and wait till other group members approve the pull request. 

### Everytime when you are working on the repo again, don't forget to git pull the latest version of our repo to you local. 
```
git branch xxxx (next time when you work, go to your own branch)
git pull origin main (make sure you have the latest version of the main branch before you work)
```
